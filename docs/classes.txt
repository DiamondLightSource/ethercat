* Classes
** ListNode<T>
Base template class that allows its instances to be included in
ELLISTs, because of its common first ELLNODE element.

** ProcessDataObserver 
ListNode abstract class with methods to process pdo messages from the
scanner.

* asynPortDriver classes                      
** ecAsyn
This is an asyn port to service PDO requests. The class processes
readback from the scanner in a separate thread that fills in the
parameter system in asynPortDriver.
Read requests are processed by the base class, as they get values
directly from the parameter lists.
Write requests generate messages to the scanner that are sent through
the engine's queue system.

** Sampler 
Class that collects samples arriving from the scanner (process data
observer) and fills in to its associated waveform port class.

** WaveformPort
Asyn port driver class that implements parameters related to generic
ADC data.

** XFCPort
Asyn port driver class that serves the "MISSED" parameter to inform
of missed samples in oversampling slaves.

** ecMaster

Asyn port driver class that serves parameters related to the ethercat
master.

| Parameter name | Description                    | Origin  |
| Cycle          |                                | scanner |
| WorkingCounter |                                |         |
| Missed         |                                |         |
| WcState        |                                |         |
| Missed         | Counter for missed cycles      | IOC     |
|                | This is obtained by monitoring |         |
|                | every message from the scanner |         |

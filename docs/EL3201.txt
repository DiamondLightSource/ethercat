The EL3201 uses the Service Data Object (SDO) dictionary to configure the device.
Options include (see .chm help file for complete list)

- connected device type (PT100, raw resistance etc.)
- wiring (2, 3 or 4 wires)

To configure the device for 4 wire operation, use SDO 0x8000:0x1a

/dls_sw/work/common/rt/ethercat/bin/ethercat upload -p 2 --type uint16 0x8000 0x1a
# 0 is 2 wire, 1 is 3 wire, 2 is 4 wire
/dls_sw/work/common/rt/ethercat/bin/ethercat download -p 2 --type uint16 0x8000 0x1a 2

The configuration is stored in flash. 
All modules must be flashed correctly before being stored as spares.
SDO support is not yet part of the EPICS driver
(complete PDO and ASYN support is the priority)

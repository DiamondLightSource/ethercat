* R3.14.12.3 releases

** Release 4-0
   SDO support, released from sdo_support branch, 
   not integrated in trunk

** Release 3-1 and 3-2
   Add screens for EL2595

** Release 3-0
   Added support for the el2595 led controller.

   The slave initialisation was re-worked to allow a pdo mapping to be
   added. Previous scanner xml configuration files are not compatible.
   
   The iocbuilder support was modified to generate sync manager
   information to match the new initialisation parameters needed. 
   A new element "PdoAssignment" was added for slaves that require an 
   additional pdo mapping at startup.

   The release also addresses the generic ADC scaling. EGUF/EGUL
   values of analogue records will need to be modified if using
   generic adc support.

* Notes on generic ADC implementation on Ethercat
Ronaldo Mercado
December 2013

The gadc "generic adc" is an asyn port driver that accumulates samples
from the ethercat scanner to provide waveforms and averaged ADC
values.  It was written by James Rowland based on Pete Leicester’s
requirements document for the VME ADCs TDI-CTRL-REQ-015.

The AdcControl.edl exposes the driver parameters for the generic ADC
implementation in EtherCAT, as

The $(P):ADC1_SAMPLES record sets the driver’s sample count for
whenthe interrupts are generated (MODE set to continuous acquisition
and the VALUE record has to be set to I/O Interrupt). The units are
samples at the driver sampling frequency, 1 KHz.

For example if the $(P):ADC1_SAMPLES is set to 50, an interrupt is
generated every 50 ms.

ADC1_AVERAGE is the number of samples used for averaging in the gated
of triggered modes (see below). The units are samples at the driver
sampling frequency, 1 KHz.

* Options in AdcControl.edl

These provide options for gated acquisition and triggered acquisition.

An offset (in samples) can be set, so that the window captured is
offset with the trigger, either before or after the trigger.

The use case during the driver development was the capture of vacuum
events at 100 KHz in front ends. 

I am not aware of this facility being in use.

I haven’t looked at how to generate a trigger from hardware (the VME
equivalent ADCs have physical connectors in the front of the carrier).

* Waveform capture in continous acquisition

For continuous acquisition, the ADC1_SAMPLES record controls how
frequent the updates are and if one wishes to acquire complete
waveforms.

The number of elements in the ADC1_WAVEFORM record has to match to
allow the capture of contiguous data.

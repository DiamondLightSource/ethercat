Clarification of oversampling configuration
===========================================

The configuration xml uses "oversample" too liberally.

There are two types of "oversample" as used in the configuration xml.

For the pdo entries, "oversample" can be 0 or 1 (boolean) It is
determined by checking whether the requested oversampling rate is
among the list of device specified rates as checked in the ethercat
slave information file at xpath
//Device/Dc/OpMode/Sm/Pdo@OSFac

For the device entry, "oversample" is the oversampling rate (count,
e.g. 10 samples per pdo message).

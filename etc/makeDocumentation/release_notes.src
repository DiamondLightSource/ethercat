\page release_notes Release notes

\section rel4_5 Release 4-5
   Added ESI device descriptions to support EL3202-0010 revision 0x0014000a (Jira BC-128)

\section rel4_3 Release 4-3
   Add severity to records when bus disconnected

An extra metadata parameter per slave is sent by the scanner to
indicate the status of the cyclic slave information request
ecrt_master_get_slave.  This value is used when not zero to indicate
an asynDisconnected status for the port which translates into an
invalid severity for the records using the slave's asyn port.

\section rel4_2 Release 4-2
   Add scanner support for multiple masters

\section rel4_1 Release 4-1
   Fix EL3702 oversampling support broken since 3-x
   Dls trac #8598
   Add doxygen documentation

\section rel4_0 Release 4-0
   SDO support, released from sdo_support branch,
   not integrated in trunk

\section rel3_1 Release 3-1 and 3-2
   Add screens for EL2595

\section rel3_0 Release 3-0
   Added support for the el2595 led controller.

   The slave initialisation was re-worked to allow a pdo mapping to be
   added. Previous scanner xml configuration files are not compatible.

   The iocbuilder support was modified to generate sync manager
   information to match the new initialisation parameters needed.
   A new element "PdoAssignment" was added for slaves that require an
   additional pdo mapping at startup.

   The release also addresses the generic ADC scaling. EGUF/EGUL
   values of analogue records will need to be modified if using
   generic adc support.

Up to release 2-2, these are releases from the 'rhel6' branch in subversion.
From release 2-3 these are releases from 'trunk'

   Modified scaling to improve support of 24-bit ADCs

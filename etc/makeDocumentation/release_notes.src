\section rel6_0 Release 6-0

BREAKING CHANGE for EL4134.template
The scaling records :VOLTAGE were removed, as scaling from
engineering units (-10V to 10V) to the raw integer for
device output can be done directly in the AO :ANALOG records.
Note that this doesn't change any macros, the only change is
the 4 :VOLTAGE and 4 :CALCANALOG records have been removed.

\section rel5_3 Release 5-3

Add integral parameter to generic ADC.
Use busy record for triggered acquisition.
Update GADC documentation. Fixes jira issue I21-389.

\section rel5_2 Release 5-2

Added template for single channel control for EL4134 module,
includes embedded and standalone edm gui

\section rel5_1 Release 5-1

Added control pvs to EL4134 template so demand value can be
set in volts (-10 o 10 V) using the :VOLTAGE records, which
are then converted to 16 bit integer used by the :ANALOG records
which were introduced in version 5-0

\section rel5_0 Release 5-0

BREAKING CHANGE the EL4134 template now has shorter PV names,
using the amended maketemplate script to generate it so the
long pv names are substituted for this device.

This changes the output pv names for the EL4134

\section rel4_12 Release 4-12

The EL4134 template's 4 output records had lengthy names, duplicate
records have been added for these 4 channels with shorter names
that should fit inside the EPICS 40 character limit when linking
records.

\section rel4_11 Release 4-11

New module, el2502 (0x001a0000)), a 2-channel PWM output using 
24 volts and 16-bit control of each channel.
Includes a template for the module itself, a template for an 
individual channel of the module that comes with edm screens.

The screens can be referred to as $(name) for the main screen,
and $(name)-embed for the embedded screen.

\section rel4_10 Release 4-10

Added gui screem for el2624 (4-channel relay), with macros in the 
el2624 template file. There are now 4 instances of the embedded edm 
file that come with an instance of the el2624 template.

\section rel4_9 Release 4-9

Rename template for EP3314-0002 slave.<br>

It was found that a possible upgrade of the module to revision 13
(0x0130002) would cause the template to no longer work. This is because
between revision 12 and 13 (0x00120002 and 0x00130002) of this model
of slave, the PDO names have changed.  The slave description files
include the pdo names, the names are propagated as parameter names for
the slave's asyn port. Solves DLS jira issue BC-376.  Further notes in
<a href="http://confluence.diamond.ac.uk/x/3YPtAw">DLS confluence</a>.

\section rel4_8 Release 4-8

Update documentation and merge in modifications needed to support
ADEthercat module.

Merged updated Beckhoff slave description files to allow use of slaves
with newer revisions. In particular the slaves below.

EL2595 revision 0x130000
EL3702 revision 0x30000,
EL3104 revision 0x130000
EL3602 revision 0x130000
EL1014 revision 0x130000
EL2124 revision 0x110000

\section rel4_7 Release 4-7

Add "version.h" to encode a module version used to verify that scanner
and ioc are running the same release.  Unmatched releases can cause
unexpected results to show upstream, because possible changes in the
mapping of the packets sent from the scanner to the EPICS ioc. (jira bc-210)

Modify serialtool and slaveinfo programs to check slaves are supported
(jira bc-131)

\section rel4_6 Release 4-6
   Changes to CSS screens

\section rel4_5 Release 4-5
   Added ESI device descriptions to support EL3202-0010 revision 0x0014000a (Jira BC-128)

\section rel4_3 Release 4-3
   Add severity to records when bus disconnected

An extra metadata parameter per slave is sent by the scanner to
indicate the status of the cyclic slave information request
ecrt_master_get_slave.  This value is used when not zero to indicate
an asynDisconnected status for the port which translates into an
invalid severity for the records using the slave's asyn port.

\section rel4_2 Release 4-2
   Add scanner support for multiple masters

\section rel4_1 Release 4-1
   Fix EL3702 oversampling support broken since 3-x
   Dls trac #8598
   Add doxygen documentation

\section rel4_0 Release 4-0
   SDO support, released from sdo_support branch,
   not integrated in trunk

\section rel3_1 Release 3-1 and 3-2
   Add screens for EL2595

\section rel3_0 Release 3-0
   Added support for the el2595 led controller.

   The slave initialisation was re-worked to allow a pdo mapping to be
   added. Previous scanner xml configuration files are not compatible.

   The iocbuilder support was modified to generate sync manager
   information to match the new initialisation parameters needed.
   A new element "PdoAssignment" was added for slaves that require an
   additional pdo mapping at startup.

   The release also addresses the generic ADC scaling. EGUF/EGUL
   values of analogue records will need to be modified if using
   generic adc support.

Up to release 2-2, these are releases from the 'rhel6' branch in subversion.
From release 2-3 these are releases from 'trunk'

\section rel2_3 Release 2-3 05/02/14
   Add documentation related to generic ADC.
   Include patch by Damien Lynch.

\section rel2_2 Release 2-2 29/10/13
   Create asyn parameter to describe each slave
   Modified scaling to improve support of 24-bit ADCs
   Modified templates for EP3204-0002 and EP3314-0002 to show values
   in deg C

\section rel2_1 Release 2-1 19/07/13
   Modifications in iocbuilder support

\section rel2_0 Release 2-0 11/07/13
   Release prepared for RHEL6 systems

   uses patched ethercat library

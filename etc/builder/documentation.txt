* Ethercat signal specification

The hierarchy to specify a signal in an ethercat slave goes:

| concept      | class in ethercat.py      |
|--------------+---------------------------|
| Slave        | EthercatDevice            |
| Sync Manager | SyncManager               |
| Pdo          | Pdo                       |
| Pdo entry    | PdoEntry and PaddingEntry |

To specify a signal in an ethercat chain, there are these two
additional concepts

| concept       | class in ethercat.py |
|---------------+----------------------|
| chain element | EthercatChainElem    |
| chain         | EthercatChain        |

The chain element links a chain position with a device

The difference between EthercatChainElem and EthercatDevice is that a
chain element has a position in a bus (chain)

* Builder classes

The way a chain is specified in the builder description is

| concept        | class in devices.py |
|----------------+---------------------|
| master         | EthercatMaster      |
| slave          | EthercatSlave       |
| pdo assignment | PdoAssignement      |
| generic ADC    | GenericADC          |
  
The slave entry for the builder includes the position in the chain

The pdo assignment entry for the builder is needed when a non-default
PDO needs to be assigned to a device. The assignment will be done at
the device level, that is, all devices of the given type in the chain
will have the same pdo assignments.

This may be revised if the need arises.

* Pdo entry padding

It was found that the padding is needed when assigning pdos that are
not in the default set. It is assumed that the only important
information in the padding field is the bit length "bitlen" and the
padding entry object will always have index and subindex values equal
to zero.

* Parsing of Ethercat slave information (ESI) files

The slave information files include the signal specification mapping
for the ethercat slaves and are parsed to generate scanner
descriptions.

It is assumed that slaves have up to four sync managers.
This is explicit in the "assignedPdos" dictionary in an
EthercatChainElem object.

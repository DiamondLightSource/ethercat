# NOTE: The build does not check dependancies on files

# "gnumake clean uninstall install" in the top directory
# each time EPICS_BASE, SNCSEQ, or any other external
# module defined in the RELEASE file is rebuilt.

#If using the sequencer, uncomment this line:
#SNCSEQ=/home/diamond/R3.14.7/prod/support/seq/2-0-10

# EPICS_BASE usually appears last so other apps can override stuff:

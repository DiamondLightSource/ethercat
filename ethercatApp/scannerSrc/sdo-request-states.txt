States in an EC_SDO_ENTRY

1) SDO_PROC_IDLE
Normal state and at startup

2) SDO_PROC_REQ
This state is entered when an sdo request message
SDO_REQ_MESSAGE is received for this sdo entry

3) SDO_PROC_READ, processing read
This state is entered once the ecrt_sdo_request_read is issued
In this state the sdo entry will query for its ecrt_sdo_request_state
and remain in this state while busy (EC_REQUEST_BUSY)

The exit paths are when the state becomes:
EC_REQUEST_SUCCESS - then the sdo is read and the sdo entry enters the send state
EC_REQUEST_ERROR   - then the sdo entry enters the send state

4) SDO_PROC_SEND,
The sdo entry waits to be picked up by the ticking process in cyclic_task.
When an SDO_READ_MESSAGE is sent, the state reverts to idle.

5) SDO_PROC_WRITEREQ,
This state is entered when an sdo write message
SDO_WRITE_MESSAGE is received for this sdo entry

6) SDO_PROC_WRITE, processing write
This state is entered once the ecrt_sdo_request_write is issued by the ticking loop in cyclic_task

In this state the sdo entry will query for its ecrt_sdo_request_state
and remain in this state while busy (EC_REQUEST_BUSY)

The exit paths are when the state becomes:
EC_REQUEST_SUCCESS or EC_REQUEST_ERROR   - then the sdo entry enters the idle state
